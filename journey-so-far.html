                            The Indian Football Association is deeply rooted in the
                            history of the game in the sub-continent. From one
                            watershed day in the mid-nineteenth century when
                            Nagendra Prasad Adhikari became the first Indian to kick
                            a football to an extreme yearning for the game in the
                            current millennium, IFA has firmly stayed the course to
                            shape footballing dreams across generations. Nagendra
                            Prasad’s fascination with the game triggered the birth of
                            a series of clubs, Calcutta FC being the first one to be
                            established, in 1872. With football gaining momentum,
                            clubs like Dalhousie, Traders and Naval Volunteers
                            emerged. In the intense rush for football, Mohun Bagan
                            and Aryan were founded in Calcutta in the 1890s. As
                            football began unfolding its many wonders to Indians,
                            Calcutta became the hub of the game in the country
                            during the British rule and has continued to retain that
                            exclusivity to date. Tournaments like Gladstone Cup,
                            Trades Cup and the Cooch Behar Cup became regular
                            features in the football calendar around that time. But
                            the rules of the game did not appear to be uniform for
                            all these competitions as they were played in step with
                            diverse interpretations of the laws by football exponents of
                            that era.

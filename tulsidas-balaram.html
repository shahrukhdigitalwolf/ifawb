                        ‘Chuni- Balaram-PK’ had actually turned into a popular refrain in Indian football back in the day. Though Tulsidas
                        Balaram did not have the flair of his good friend Chuni Goswami or the speed of Pradip Kumar Banerjee, what he
                        possessed was a rarity in the football of the ‘60s – versatility. Born in an obscure village hear the southern
                        Indian city of Secundrabad, Balaram’s talents were discovered by ‘Rahib Saab’, one of India’s best-known football
                        coaches. The struggle of his family to make both ends meet just couldn’t douse Balaram’s burning desire to make the
                        cut as a footballer as he began his playing career with Army Combined Force Club. Soon, his skills help him get a
                        berth in the Hyderabad team for the Santosh Trophy. He shot to fame a year later when he scored twice in a 4-1 win
                        against Bombay to help his state lift the coveted trophy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest, as they say, is history. Balaram was immediately drafted into the Indian side for the 1956 Olympic Games,
                        where India’s performance had stunned the world. The very next year, Balaram shifted club-allegiance to join East
                        Bengal, where he stayed till the end of this career. Balaram was not a physically imposing player but not diminutive
                        either. His brilliant ball skills and subtle feigns had tormented his traditional opponents in Mohun Bagan. His
                        legendary rivalry with Bagan’s Jarnail Singh and Chuni Goswami never weighed on their off-field frienshi. Balaram,
                        who played as a left-inside forward those days, scored 78 goals in his eight seasons in Kolkata.
                    </p>

            </div>
            <div class="row">
                
                <div class="col-lg-8 order-2 order-lg-1">
                    <p>
                        Not just at home, Balaram’s prowess was getting the better of teams, which was evident at the 1962 Asiad when he
                        teamed up with Chuni and PK to make short work of Thailand, Japan and South Korea, scoring against the former two
                        and assisting Goswami against the latter.The brilliance of Balaram’s brand of football spilled onto the Olympic
                        arena as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After falling behind Hungary 0-2, Balaram punted a great assist from Chuni into the Hungarian goal to
                        reduce the margin and repeated his spectacular show in a game against France that India lost narrowly due to a
                        defensive lapse. Balaram’s best moment in international football came against Hong Kong in the 1958 Asiad. The
                        mmatch spilled into extra-time with the two teams tied at 2-2 in full-time. It was then that Balaram turned his
                        magic on with two assists and one goal to help India clinch the issue 5-2. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Balaram became the captain of East Bengal in 1961, which was a glorious season for him. Marshalling his resources
                        from the front like a true general, he finished the season as the top scorer with 23 goals and also bagged the best
                        player award.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Balaram was equipped with a unique sense of football as he could improvise instantly while playing and brought a lot
                        of variety to the game with his kind of play, so much so that at one point a section of the
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        discernible felt that he was better than even Chuni, arguably India’s best-ever football player. Balaram received
                        the Arjuna Award in 1962 and was expected to continue playing for some more years but, due to nagging health
                        problems, he retired from the game in 1963, leaving behind a rich legacy and the ‘Chuni-Balaram-PK’ refrain that
                        still does the rounds of the football circuit of India.
